# General notes about rhythm games
See [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhythmgames/comments/1luzkbj/what_are_things_that_bother_you_about_rhythm_games/)

- Having no songs that you like at a specific skill level. For example, you want to practice at level 6 or 7, but all you favorite songs at level 5 or 9, then you are forced to pracise with songs you don't like -> can be solved by having different levels within a single song and encouraging users to actually create those different levels for a single song
- People don't like combo scoring
- Have a practice mode that allows players to play a specific part of a song a variable speed
- Have good quality charting and don't have too many different note types
- People like original song and songs that are specific to that rhythm game
- But also have familiar songs to attract people with something familiar
- Again, not too many note types. Just a single tap and a hold is already plenty
- Have custom hit sounds, custom bar visuals, etc.
- People hate it when online is mandatory. They like having an offline mode
- Have many features and songs for players to practice on all levels. Not just for beginners.
