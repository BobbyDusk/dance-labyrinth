# General notes about rhythm games
See [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhythmgames/comments/1luzkbj/what_are_things_that_bother_you_about_rhythm_games/)

- Having no songs that you like at a specific skill level. For example, you want to practice at level 6 or 7, but all you favorite songs at level 5 or 9, then you are forced to pracise with songs you don't like -> can be solved by having different levels within a single song and encouraging users to actually create those different levels for a single song
- People don't like combo scoring
- Have a practice mode that allows players to play a specific part of a song a variable speed
- Have good quality charting and don't have too many different note types
- People like original song and songs that are specific to that rhythm game
- But also have familiar songs to attract people with something familiar
- Again, not too many note types. Just a single tap and a hold is already plenty
- Have custom hit sounds, custom bar visuals, etc.
- People hate it when online is mandatory. They like having an offline mode
- Have many features and songs for players to practice on all levels. Not just for beginners.
- Enforce a fun, welcoming community
- People like having multiple difficulties for a single song. The difficulty levels should be consistent. Maybe some kind of definition for what makes easy, medium, hard, ultra, etc.
- No gimmicks. Just clean gameplay
- Should definitely have audio lag / timing calibration
- Players love having lots of customization options for the controls.
- Have songs and charts for all levels.
- There should be a quick restart hotkey. No fancy animation or shit like that. Just clean quick restart.
- Have adjustable speed (song and chart) for practicing.
- NO COMBO SCORING
- But at the same time, also have some other system that encourages players to strive for perfection, like having a counter for the number of misses. Have real incentive to get good.
- The scoring should be about accuracy. A score should really tell you something about how good a player is.
- Have an easily readable score. You can have additional info that is presented on the player's request. But by default, it should be a very siple main score.
